### Hi there 👋, I’m Đặng Chí Thanh

I'm a **Senior Frontend Engineer** and **Web Team Lead** with 6+ years of professional experience, currently working across multiple projects and companies. I specialize in building scalable, high-performance web applications using **React (Next.js)**, **Vue (Nuxt.js)**, **TypeScript**, **Astro**, and modern frontend tooling.

I’m passionate about:
- ⚡ Web performance optimization & clean architecture
- 🤝 Team collaboration, mentoring, and leading engineering teams
- 🧠 Learning and exploring new technologies, especially **AI**

Currently, I’m pursuing a second degree in **Artificial Intelligence** at UIT – aiming to bridge my strong frontend foundation with the world of intelligent systems and products. I actively learn about **AI applications**, **cloud computing**, and **developer workflows**, and I enjoy building tools that enhance productivity and user experience.

> I believe in continuous learning, sharing knowledge, and building tech that matters.
